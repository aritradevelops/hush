# Contributing to Hush

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Hush! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

Before creating an issue, please:
1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Use the appropriate issue template
3. Provide as much detail as possible

### Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! Please:
1. Use the feature request template
2. Explain the use case and benefits
3. Consider if it aligns with our privacy-first mission

### Code Contributions

#### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hush.git
   cd hush
   ```

3. **Set up development environment**

   #### Server setup
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm ci
   cp .env.example .env
   npm run d:db
   npm run typeorm:migrate
   npm run dev
   ```

   - `cd server`: Enter the backend server directory.
   - `npm ci`: Install exact dependency versions from `package-lock.json` for a clean, reproducible install.
   - `cp .env.example .env`: Create your local environment file using the example as a template.
   - `npm run d:db`: Start the Postgres database via Docker Compose as defined under `server/db`.
   - `npm run typeorm:migrate`: Run database migrations to create/update schema.
   - `npm run dev`: Start the development server with hot-reload.

   #### Client setup
   ```bash
   cd clients/web
   npm ci
   npm run dev
   ```

   - `cd clients/web`: Enter the Next.js web client directory.
   - `npm ci`: Install exact dependency versions for the client.
   - `npm run dev`: Start the Next.js development server. 

4. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
### Create an Account (Local Development)
   1. Ensure both the backend (server) and frontend (client) are running without errors.
   2. Open http://localhost:3000/register in your browser.
   3. Register with any email address (for local development, a non-real/fake email is fine).
   4. Check the backend server terminal output. A verification URL will be printed to the console.
   5. Click that verification link (or copy-paste it into your browser) to verify the account.
   6. After verification, go to http://localhost:3000/login and sign in with your credentials.

   Notes:
   - If you do not see a verification link, confirm the backend is running and watch its logs for the printed URL.
   - In production, emails are sent via a real provider; in local development, the link is intentionally logged to the console for convenience.


#### Development Guidelines

##### Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Write meaningful commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Ensure all code is properly typed

##### Testing
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Ensure existing functionality isn't broken
- Add tests for new features when possible

##### Security Considerations
- **Never commit encryption keys or secrets**
- Follow security best practices for crypto operations
- Be extra careful with authentication and authorization code
- Review encryption implementations with maintainers

#### Commit Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:
```
type: description

Examples:
feat: add OAuth2 integration
fix: resolve key generation issue
docs: update installation instructions
refactor: improve connection handling
```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Test your changes**
   - Run the development server
   - Test the web client
   - Verify encryption/decryption works
   - Check for any console errors

3. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use the PR template
   - Provide a clear description
   - Link related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

4. **Respond to feedback**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Make requested changes
   - Keep the PR focused and atomic

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### Backend (`/server`)
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Business logic and data processing
- **Entities**: Database models and relationships
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Socket**: Real-time communication handlers
- **CLI**: Code generation tools

### Frontend (`/clients/web`)
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks
- **Contexts**: State management
- **Workers**: Background processing for encryption
- **Lib**: Utility functions and helpers

## üîê Security Guidelines

### Encryption Implementation
- All encryption must happen client-side
- Use Web Crypto API for cryptographic operations
- Never store encryption keys on the server
- Follow established patterns for key exchange

### Authentication & Authorization
- Implement proper RBAC checks
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure session management
- Follow JWT best practices

### File Handling
- Validate file types and sizes
- Implement proper sanitization
- Use secure upload/download patterns
- Handle encryption/decryption in workers

## üß™ Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Start PostgreSQL database
2. Run server migrations
3. Start the backend server
4. Start the frontend development server
5. Test your changes

### Code Generation
The project includes CLI tools for generating CRUD operations:
```bash
# Generate new CRUD module
npm run cli g:crud ModuleName

# Remove CRUD module
npm run cli r:crud ModuleName

# Generate query code
npm run cli g:query
```
